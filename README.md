### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Pierpaolo, nice to meet you!
I am a full-stack developer and Consultant from Italy: welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ”­ About Me

Passionate about technology and IT since when I was a kid, I started up with programming by writing my own Minecraft plugins for my server.
Since then, my path and curiosity brought me through various stacks and programming languages, which helped me forge this passion and gain expertise in various fields.

In 2019, I was hired at [alpenite](https://alpenite.com), which is the company I am currently working for.
Here, I had the chance to apply knowledge and learn something new everyday.
My path towards process analysis and continuous improvement/optimization made me become Service Manager, and soon Performance Manager.
